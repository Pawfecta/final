          <h3><strong>Bulldog üçñ</strong></h3>
          <p>
            Kind but courageous, friendly but dignified, the Bulldog is a
            thick-set, low-slung, well-muscled bruiser whose 'sourmug' face is
            the universal symbol of courage and tenacity. These docile, loyal
            companions adapt well to town or country. You can't mistake a
            Bulldog for any other breed.

          <h3><strong>Retriever ‚ù§Ô∏è</strong> </h3>
          <p>
            A sturdy, muscular dog of medium size, famous for the dense,
            lustrous coat of gold that gives the breed its name. The broad head,
            with its friendly and intelligent eyes, short ears, and straight
            muzzle, is a breed hallmark.

          <h3><strong>Shepherd üê∂</strong> </h3>
          <p>
            Generally considered dogkind's finest all-purpose worker, the German
            Shepherd Dog is a large, agile, muscular dog of noble character and
            high intelligence. Loyal, confident, courageous, and steady, the
            German Shepherd is truly a dog lover's delight.

          <h3><strong>Siberian Husky ‚ùÑÔ∏è</strong></h3>
          <p>
            A thickly coated, compact sled dog of medium size and great
            endurance, was developed to work in packs, pulling light loads at
            moderate speeds over vast frozen expanses. Sibes are friendly,
            fastidious, and dignified.

          <h3><strong>Scottish Fold üò∏</strong></h3>
          <p>
            A natural dominant gene mutation that affects cartilage throughout
            the body, causing the ears to "fold", bending forward and down
            towards the front of the head, which gives the cat what is often
            described as an "owl-like" appearance.

          <h3><strong>British Shorthair üòª</strong></h3>
          <p>
            A broad chest, muscular neck, strong jaws and a well developed
            muzzle. The legs are thick and strong. The breed looks like what she
            originally was, a cat that was to keep rodents out of the barn and
            the house. The coat of the British is thick and dense.

          <h3><strong>Dutch rabbit üê∞</strong></h3>
          <p>
            A small-medium sized animal with a compact body and large erect ears
            that are well furred. Rabbits are known for their long, strong hind
            legs and tend to hop rather than walk. Their feet contain long claws
            for traction and have fur on the bottom for warmth.

          <h3><strong>Red factor Canary üê¶</strong></h3>
          <p>
            A popular variety of canary. It is named after its colourful
            plumage, and is a 'color canary', bred for the novelty of its color
            rather than for its song. It is kept by those who want a pet, as
            well as those who enjoy showing.
